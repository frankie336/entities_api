Llamas are domesticated South American camelids, widely used as meat and pack animals by Andean cultures.
An adult llama can reach 1.7 to 1.8 meters in height and weigh between 130 to 200 kilograms.
They are social animals and live in herds. Llamas are known for their intelligence and can learn simple tasks quickly.
They communicate through a variety of sounds including humming and alarm calls.
Llamas have an excellent sense of sight and smell, which helps them detect predators.
