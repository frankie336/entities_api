### Summary of Recommendations:

You are already doing a good job applying the `_` convention to many internal helper methods (like `_get_service`, `_init_*`, `_process_*`, `_handle_*`, `_set_up_context_window`).

Consider renaming the following methods to follow the convention, as they primarily serve as internal helpers or validation logic for the public orchestration methods:

*   `parse_code_interpreter_partial` -> `_parse_code_interpreter_partial`
*   `is_valid_function_call_response` -> `_is_valid_function_call_response`
*   `is_complex_vector_search` -> `_is_complex_vector_search`
*   `handle_error` -> `_handle_error`
*   `finalize_conversation` -> `_finalize_conversation`
*   `parse_nested_function_call_json` -> `_parse_nested_function_call_json` (if only used internally)

The rest of the methods seem appropriately public based on their roles as entry points, service accessors, state managers, general utilities, or abstract definitions.
