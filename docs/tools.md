## Tools Overview

**Tools** allow an assistant to interact directly with external systems, data sources, or perform specific tasks in the real world. For example, a tool could enable interactions with a developer-defined database, API, or service.

There are two distinct categories of tools:

- **Core Platform Tools** (commonly referred to as "tools"): These are built-in functionalities provided by the assistant platform itself.
- **Developer-defined Tools** (commonly known as "function calls"): These are custom extensions created by developers to augment the assistant's capabilities according to specific application needs.
