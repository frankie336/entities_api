# Open Source Dev Environment Bootstrap Guide

A step-by-step guide to get your local development environment up and running.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+  
- Docker & Docker Compose  
- A copy of the repository cloned locally  
- Your `.env` file in the project root (do **not** commit secrets)

---

## 1. Create Initial Admin User


1. **Build the initial containers**  
   ```bash
   python start.py
   ```

2. **Run the bootstrap script**  
   ```bash
   python scripts/bootstrap_admin.py
   ```
3. **Locate credentials**  
   - A file named `admin_credentials.txt` will be generated.  
   - **Do NOT** commit this file to Git.
4. **Populate your `.env`**  
   Open `.env` and add:
   ```dotenv
   ADMIN_API_KEY=<value from admin_credentials.txt>
   ADMIN_USER_ID=<value from admin_credentials.txt>
   ```

The Admin user API key, ADMIN_API_KEY should be automatically populated in your .env, but it doesn't 
hurt to double-check, and add the value from admin_credentials.txt if it is not already there.

## 2. Create Initial Normal User

1. **Run the user‚Äêcreation script**  
   ```bash
   python scripts/create_user.py
   ```
2. **Follow the interactive prompts**  
   - Copy the generated API key and user ID at the end.

The create user script, create_user.py is a flexible reusable script used to provision consumer level 
api users. Please note that this API key is meant for use by consumer users of your instance of Entities API. 
There is no limit on the number of users you can provision. 

---
## 3. Rebuild & Restart the API Service

You must rebuild the API (and sandbox) service so that new environment variable for the admin API key 
is applied to the current container instance.

1. **Tear down any running containers**  
   ```bash
   python start.py --down
   ```

2. **Rebuild services**  
   - **Individually**:  
     ```bash
     python start.py --mode build --service api
     python start.py --mode build --service sandbox
     ```  
   - **Or both at once**:  
     ```bash
     python start.py --mode both
     ```

---

## 4. Configure Your Applications

Whether you‚Äôre working on the backend or frontend:

- Ensure your application‚Äôs environment (or settings) includes:
  ```dotenv
  ENTITIES_API_KEY=<from step 2>
  ENTITIES_USER_ID=<from step 2>
  ```

---

## 5. Verify

1. **Start the stack**  
   ```bash
   python start.py --mode up
   ```
2. **Log in as Admin**  
   - Use the credentials from `admin_credentials.txt`  
   - Confirm that you can create and view resources.
3. **Log in as Normal User**  
   - Use the credentials you saved from the create_user script  
   - Ensure permissions are applied correctly.

---

You‚Äôre now ready to develop against the open-source API stack! üéâ

1. **Use**  
   ```bash
   !pip install projectdavid
   
   from projectdavid import Entity
    
   client = Entity(
    base_url=os.getenv("BASE_URL", "http://localhost:9000"),
    api_key=os.getenv("ENTITIES_API_KEY")
   )
   
   ```
