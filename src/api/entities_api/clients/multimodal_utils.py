# src/api/entities_api/clients/multimodal_utils.py
"""
Shared multimodal utilities for OpenAI-compatible providers.

Used by:
    - vllm_raw_stream.py   (vLLM /v1/chat/completions path)
    - qwen_base.py         (TogetherAI, Hyperbolic, etc.)
    - deepseek_worker.py   (Hyperbolic DeepSeek/VL models)
    - default_worker.py    (NVIDIA, etc.)
    - gpt_oss_worker.py    (GPT-OSS providers)

NOT used by:
    - ollama_client.py     (Ollama has its own format: images as a sibling
                            key with raw base64 — see _normalise_for_ollama)

The functions here produce the standard OpenAI multimodal message format:
    {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,..."}}

This is the format accepted by vLLM, TogetherAI, Hyperbolic, and any other
provider that follows the OpenAI vision spec.

Provider image limits (enforced via max_images parameter):
    - TogetherAI  : unlimited (default)
    - vLLM local  : unlimited (default)
    - Ollama      : 1 per message (enforced in ollama_client._normalise_for_ollama)
    - Hyperbolic  : 1 per request (pass max_images=1 in deepseek_worker)

    Accepts the internal hydrated format produced by NativeExecutionService
    .hydrate_messages() and converts it to the OpenAI vision spec that vLLM,
    TogetherAI, Hyperbolic, and compatible providers accept.

    Hydrated input:
